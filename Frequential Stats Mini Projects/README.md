# Inferential Statistics  - Frequentist 

## Learning objectives:

Welcome to the first Frequentist inference mini-project! Over the course of working on these two mini-projects, we'll learn the fundamental concepts associated with frequentist inference. 
The following list includes the topics we will become familiar with as we work through these two mini-projects:

* the normal distribution 
* the _z_-statistic
* the _t_-statistic
* the difference and relationship between the two
* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval and p-values
* how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests
